# Demo Application for PHP with MySQL

A simple festival management system built using PHP and MySQL. The system allows users to view a list of festivals, along with their name, location, price, date, and creation date. The festivals are displayed in a grid layout, with each festival having its own card. The cards have a background color that is stored in the database, and the text color is automatically determined based on the background color to ensure readability.
